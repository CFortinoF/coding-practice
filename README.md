# 🧠 Coding Practice Repository

Welcome to my coding practice repository! This repo is dedicated to my journey of improving my programming skills
through structured coursework and hands-on problem solving. I am using this to supplement what I learned in
my traditional bachelors education and keep my coding skills sharp for technical interviews.

Currently, I'm working through the following courses:

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/)
